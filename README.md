# üì∏ Photo Helper

A simple Electron app that helps photographers and editors filter and copy specific photos from a large collection based on a list of filenames.

## Features

- **Smart Number Parsing**: Just paste photo numbers in any format - handles bullets, numbering, mixed lists
- **Flexible Input**: Works with full filenames OR just numbers (e.g., "3185" finds "WED_3185.JPG")
- **Live Preview**: See parsed numbers and matching files in real-time as you type
- **Smart Destinations**: Auto-create folders in Downloads OR select any existing folder
- **Multi-format Support**: Copies all matching files (RAW + JPG of same shot)
- **Detailed Results**: See which files were successfully copied, which weren't found, and which failed

## How to Use

1. **Paste Your List**: Copy photo numbers or names in any format:

   ```
   3185
   3190
   ‚Ä¢ 3555
   1. 5504
   IMG_1234.JPG
   ```

2. **See Live Preview**: Watch as numbers are parsed and matching files are found

3. **Select Source Folder**: Click "Browse" to choose the folder containing your original photos

4. **Choose Destination**:
   - **Auto-create**: Type a folder name (creates in Downloads)
